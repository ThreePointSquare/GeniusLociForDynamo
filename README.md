***Genius Loci*** is a compilation of +350 custom nodes for the [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.com/) environment.
The vast majority of nodes are written in Python and related to Revit.
Particular emphasis is placed on interoperability and many nodes can handle with DWG, DWF, NWC and IFC files.
Another goal is to interact easily with linked files and Revit documents. 
Other categories of nodes focus on automating dimensions and managing materials and graphics.

Genius Loci is compatible with Dynamo 2.x. Revit 2017 to Revit 2024.
Make sure to have the DynamoIronPython2.7 package installed for Dynamo 2.16/17 in Revit 2023/24.

Feedbacks, [issues](https://github.com/albandechasteigner/GeniusLociForDynamo/issues), [pull request](https://github.com/albandechasteigner/GeniusLociForDynamo/pulls) and suggestions for improvement are welcome and can be reported in the repository.

Some custom nodes were inspired by the brilliant authors of the packages like archi-lab.net, Clockwork and Springs and adapted to meet my needs.
Thanks to the original authors for their great Python scripts and for everything they taught me by analyzing them..
